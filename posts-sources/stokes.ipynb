    "In the last post, we looked at variational principles by studying the minimal surface equation.\n",
    "Much of what you learn in multivariable calculus carries over equally well to infinite-dimensional spaces and we were able to leverage a lot of this intuition to design efficient solution procedures.\n",
    "For example, the notion of convexity carries over to variatonal problems and using this idea we can show that Newton's method is effective in this setting as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we solved the minimal surface equation, our solution space consists of all functions that satisfy a set of Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n",
    "These conditions are easy to eliminate so our problem is essentially unconstrained.\n",
    "In this post, we'll look at the Stokes equations, which are a *constrained* optimization problem.\n",
    "For unconstrained problems, the convexity of the objective implies a kind of stability property that we can use to prove that roughly any finite element basis will give a convergent approximation scheme.\n",
    "For constrained problems we have to be much more careful about the choice of basis and this is the content of the *Ladyzhenskaya-Babu≈°ka-Brezzi* or LBB conditions, which I'll describe in a later post.\n",

    "The Stokes equations describe slow flow of very viscous, incompressible fluids.\n",
    "The fields we're solving for are the velocity $u$ and the pressure $p$.\n",

    "The remaining equations state that the stresses are in balance wth body forces:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot \\tau - \\nabla p + f = 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the rank-2 stress tensor and $f$ are the body forces.\n",
    "The stress tensor must be related somehow to the velocity field.\n",
    "For a viscous fluid, the stress tensor is related to the *rate-of-strain* tensor\n",

    "$$\\dot\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla u + \\nabla u^*\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(For solids the stress tensor is related to the gradient of the displacement rather than the velocity.)\n",
    "The simplest constitutive relation is that of a Newtonian fluid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau = 2\\mu\\dot\\varepsilon,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the viscosity.\n",
    "There are other nonlinear constitutive relations, but for now we'll just consider Newtonian fluids.\n",
    "If $U$ and $L$ are characteristic velocity and length scales for the particular flow at hand and $\\rho$ is the fluid density, the Stokes equations are a good description when the *Reynolds number* is much less than 1:\n",

    "$$\\text{Re} \\equiv \\frac{\\rho UL}{\\mu} \\ll 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Reynolds number is closer to or larger than 1, we need to use the full Navier-Stokes equations, which includes inertial effects as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stokes equations, like the Poisson equation, have a minimization principle, but for two fields instead of one.\n",
    "The variational principle is that the solution $u$, $p$ is a critical point of the rate of decrease of the *Gibbs free energy*:\n",

    "You can show using the usual tricks that the Euler-Lagrange equations for this functional are the Stokes equations.\n",
    "The free energy dissipation functional consists of a positive, quadratic term in the velocity, but the pressure $p$ only acts like a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the incompressibility condition.\n",
    "The lack of any positivity in the pressure is part of what makes the Stokes equations so challenging to discretize and solve.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above shows how to get an exact (up to rounding-error) solution to the discretized Stokes equations using MUMPS.\n",
    "For larger problems in 3D, using a direct method can become prohibitively expensive.\n",
    "The Firedrake documentation has a [demo](https://firedrakeproject.org/demos/stokes.py.html) of how to use PETSc's *field split* preconditioners, together with matrix-free operators, to solve the Stokes equations efficiently.\n",
    "In subsequent posts, I'll show more about stable discretizations of mixed problems, and how to solve the Stokes equations with more exotic boundary conditions than the standard ones we've shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity field we calculated was not exactly divergence-free and part of this was a consequence of using a boundary condition that adapted poorly to a piecewise-linear discretized geometry.\n",
    "We were able to do better by increasing the polynomial degree of the geometry, and in general this is absolutely necessary to achieve the expected rates of convergence with higher-order finite element bases.\n",
    "Nonetheless, the support for higher-order geometries in common finite element and mesh generation packages should be better given how useful they are.\n",
    "I think this is an area where a little investment in resources could make a really outsized difference.\n",
    "The logical endpoint of this line of thinking is [isogeometric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis), which is an active area of research."
