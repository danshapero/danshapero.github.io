    "### The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\n",

    "where $\\gamma$ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix.\n",
    "Ornstein originally used this system as a model for the velocity of a particle under the combined influence of friction and random collision with neighboring particles.\n",
    "With the notation above, $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient and $\\sigma$ is the collision intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like for deterministic ODE, we can use the matrix exponential and the usual [variation of parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_of_parameters) trick to write down an explicit solution of this SDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z(t) = e^{-t\\gamma}z(0) + \\sigma\\int_0^te^{-(t - s)\\gamma}\\dot\\xi(s)\\, ds.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the noise $\\dot\\xi$ is a Gaussian process and any finite sum of normal random variables is also normal, the solution $z$ is also a Gaussian process.\n",
    "If we can compute the mean and covariance function, then we know almost everything we need about the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, taking expectations can be interchanged with time integrals by Fubini's theorem.\n",
    "So if we take the expected value of the solution we'll be left with just the exponentially-decaying influence of the initial condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu(t) = \\langle z(t)\\rangle = e^{-t\\gamma}\\langle z(0)\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm leaving the expectations on the initial condition here because it too might be non-deterministic.\n",

    "The correlation between the noise terms is $\\delta(s_1 - s_2)$, but we have to remember that the integration limits on $s_2$ extend to a range $t + \\tau$ not included in the integration limits on $s_1$.\n",

    "There are two important things to observe here.\n",
    "First, the correlation function decays exponentially as the separation $\\tau$ increases.\n",
    "Second, the correlation only depends on the difference $\\tau$ between the two time points and not the value of the base time point $t$.\n",
    "This means that the process is *stationary*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the OU process is Gaussian and stationary, and, like all solutions of SDEs forced by white noise, it has the Markov property.\n",
    "The final fact (which I find to be just amazing) is that *any other* stochastic process with these three properties is identical to the OU process up to scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's enough theory for now, let's write a procedure to generate sample paths.\n",
    "Assuming that the decay rate $\\gamma$ is positive, we'll want some kind of implicit scheme to integrate the SDE in order to guarantee stability independent of the stepsize.\n",
    "The implicit Euler scheme will be good enough for our purposes.\n",
    "There is an [exact procedure](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.2084) for simulating the OU process, but it doesn't generalize to the more complex SDEs that we'll consider in the following."
