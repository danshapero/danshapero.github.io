    "In this post, I'd like to look at three stochastic dynamical systems, each a little more complex than the next.\n",
    "We'll mainly be concerned with differential equations of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot z = f(z) + \\sigma\\dot\\xi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the trajectory $z$ that we're solving for lives in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the deterministic part of the dynamics, $\\dot\\xi$ is random *white noise*, and $\\sigma$ is the noise amplitude.\n",
    "In general, $\\sigma$ could be a matrix that depends on the solution $z$ itself, but for the following we'll only consider cases where $\\sigma$ is a scalar constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't seen stochastic differential equations before, you might be wondering at this point what I mean by \"white noise\".\n",
    "White noise is characterized as a Gaussian stochastic process with zero mean and covariance function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle \\dot\\xi(s)\\dot\\xi(t)\\rangle = \\delta(t - s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function and $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ denotes statistical expectation.\n",
    "Like the delta function, white noise is a bit of a convenient fiction that we tell ourselves in order to get on with our lives -- there is no well-defined stochastic process with these properties.\n",
    "The full details of how to define [stochastic integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4_calculus) are... pretty rowdy and I don't want to go there.\n",
    "If you do want to see the gory details, you can refer to the books by [Gardiner](https://link.springer.com/book/9783540707127) or [Ã˜ksendal](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14394-6).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, it's enough to know that the solutions of this stochastic differential equation can emerge through a limit of discrete-time processes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{n + 1} = z_n + \\delta t\\cdot F(z_n, z_{n + 1}) + \\sqrt{\\delta t}\\sigma\\dot\\xi_n,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot\\xi_n$ are uncorrelated mean-zero normal random variables with variance 1, and $F$ is some function of the current and past state that makes for a consistent discretization of the deterministic part of the ODE.\n",
    "(I'm leaving room here for both explicit and implicit time discretizations.)\n",
    "The first process that we'll look at can be solved in closed form, but the next two have no analytical solution and so numerical methods are our only recourse."
