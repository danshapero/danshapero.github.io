    "In the previous post, we explored how difficult it is to solve the simplest hyperbolic conservation law, the scalar advection equation.\n",
    "To solve this PDE accurately, we had to understand how the partly arbitrary choice of a numerical flux can make or break the stability of the spatial discretization, how low order schemes are very diffusive, and how higher-order explicit schemes introduce spurious maxima and minima that we can only control through a nonlinear flux limiting procedure.\n",
    "The scalar advection equation is comparatively simple in that signals can only propagate along the predetermined velocity field.\n",
    "In this post, we'll look at something more realistic and much more difficult: the shallow water equations.\n",
    "The shallow water equations are a system of equations rather than a scalar problem, and as such they can exhibit non-trivial wave propagation in a way that the advection equation can't.\n",
    "They're a great model for testing numerical solvers because they're both simple enough to keep in your head all at once, and yet at the same time they exhibit many of the complexities of more \"serious\" models -- nonlinearity, non-trivial conserved quantities, mimetic properties, the list goes on.\n",

    "The shallow water equations can be derived from the incompressible Euler equations of fluid dynamics with a free surface under the assumption that the horizontal length scale is much longer than the vertical one.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $b$ is the bathymetry, and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n",
    "This problem is a little more complicated because of the time derivative on $h\\cdot u$, a combination of two of the state variables.\n",

    "The fact that the wave speed now depends on the solution and that waves propagate in all directions instead of only along a pre-set vector field has several consequences.\n",
    "First, we can't pick a CFL-stable timestep from the outset because the fluid velocity and thickness could increase well beyond their initial values.\n",
    "The only options for timestepping are to use an adaptive procedure or a whole mess of trial and error.\n",
    "Second, we have to think harder about numerical fluxes.\n",
    "For scalar equations, we can use the numerical flux to mimic the properties of upwind finite difference schemes, but for systems this reasoning doesn't work -- there can be waves simultaneously propagating in both normal directions at a given internal facet."

    "The vast majority of the literature you'll find on DG methods uses the Lax-Friedrichs flux.\n",

    "This can be confusing for beginners to the subject because it isn't clear at what points in the process you (the programmer) have choices to make and where you don't.\n",
    "Part of the reason for this singular focus is that the Lax-Friedrichs flux is the simplest to implement, but several studies have found -- at least for problems without shock waves -- that other flux functions offer negligible gains in accuracy; see for example [Qiu (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-006-9109-5) and [Bernard et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2009.05.046).\n",
    "In that case, there isn't much value in using a different flux function that may be more expensive to compute and make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n",
    "The choice of numerical flux is more consequential for problems with shock waves or for more complex systems (see for example [Beck et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-01601-6_11), which studied turbulent flow)."
