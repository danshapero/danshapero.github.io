    "In this post I'll look at a classic example of a convex variational problem: computing [*minimal surfaces*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface).\n",
    "The minimal surface problem has a simple physical interpretation in terms of soap films.\n",
    "Suppose you have a wire loop and you stretch a film of soap over it; what shape does the film take?\n",
    "The available energy that the film has to do mechanical work is proportional to the product of the surface tension and the area of the film.\n",
    "When the film is in equilibrium, it will minimize the energy, so it will find the surface of least area that stretches over the hoop.\n",
    "This shape is called a minimal surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll look at a geometrically simpler case where the surface can be described as the graph of a function defined on some footprint domain $\\Omega$ that lives in the plane.\n",
    "We'll describe the position of the hoop as a function $g$ that maps the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ to the reals, and the surface as a function $u$ on $\\Omega$.\n",
    "The surface area of the graph of $u$ is the quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(u) = \\int_\\Omega\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}\\,dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our goal is to minimize the objective functional $J$ among all functions $u$ such that $u|_{\\partial\\Omega} = g$.\n",
    "This is a classic example in variational calculus, which I'll assume you're familiar with.\n",
    "If you haven't encountered this topic before, I learned about it from [Weinstock's book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Calculus_of_Variations.html?id=6wSVuWH1PrsC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The weak form of the Euler-Lagrange equation for $J$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_\\Omega\\frac{\\nabla u\\cdot\\nabla v}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}}dx = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all $v$ that vanish on the boundary.\n",
    "This PDE is just a specific way of stating the general condition that, for $u$ to be an extremum of $J$, its directional derivative along all perturbations $v$ must be 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle dJ(u), v\\rangle = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go a little bit further and calculate the second derivative of $J$ too:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle d^2J(u)\\cdot v, w\\rangle = \\int_\\Omega\\frac{I - \\frac{\\nabla u\\cdot \\nabla u^*}{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}}\\nabla v\\cdot \\nabla w\\, dx,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Deriving this equation takes a bit of leg work, but the important part is that it looks like a symmetric, positive-definite elliptic operator, only the conductivity tensor depends on the gradient of $u$.\n",
    "Since the second derivative of $J$ is positive-definite, the minimization problem is convex and thus has a unique solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches you could take to solving the minimal surface equation.\n",
    "I'll examine some here using the finite element modeling package [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org).\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with Firedrake or FEniCS, their main selling point is that, rather than write code to fill matrices and vectors yourself, these packages use an embedded domain-specific language to describe the weak form of the PDE.\n",
    "The library then generates efficient C code on the spot to fill these matrices and vectors.\n",
    "Having done all this by hand for several years I can tell you this is a big improvement!"
