    "Regularization of inverse problems is a subtle topic.\n",
    "When the field we're inferring has sharp discontinuities, the total variation functional can be a better regularizer than the mean square gradient.\n",
    "There's a statistical way to make that argument more precise: TV better represents the prior information that we're claiming to have about our solution.\n",
    "Using it incurs a cost in implementation complexity, however, because the TV functional is non-smooth.\n",
    "As with the obstacle problem, the Moreau envelope provides us with a way to solve non-smooth optimization problems using tools that were designed only for smooth ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've examined what regularization functional to use here, but we haven't examined the topic of deciding how much to regularize.\n",
    "There are several procedures for choosing a value of $\\alpha$, some merely heuristic and others based on deeper insights from Bayesian statistical inference.\n",
    "In the statistical literature this is often referred to as *hyperparameter optimization* and it's arguably just as important as deciding which regularization functional to use in the first place."
