    "Plate theory is what you get when you assume the medium is thin along the vertical dimension and that this restricts the form that the displacements can take.\n",

    "It's possible that $u_x$ and $u_y$ are also offset by in-plane displacements.\n",
    "I'll assume that the boundary conditions make those equal to zero.\n",

    "I'm being a little loose in my use of the gradient operator -- it's 3D on the left-hand side of this equation and 2D on the right.\n",
    "Notice how the antisymmetric part of the displacement gradient is all in the $x-z$ and $y-z$ components.\n",
    "When we symmetrize the displacement gradient, we get the strain tensor:\n",

    "Now remember that the medium is a thin plate.\n",
