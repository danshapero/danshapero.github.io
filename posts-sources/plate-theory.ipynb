    "The first equation is momentum conservation:\n",
    "$$\\rho\\ddot u = \\nabla\\cdot\\sigma + f$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the stress tensor and $f$ the body forces.\n",
    "To close the system, we need to supply a constitutive equation relating the stress tensor and the strain tensor\n",

    "$$\\sigma = \\mathscr C\\,\\varepsilon$$\n",
    "where $\\mathscr C$ is the rank-4 elasticity tensor.\n",
    "We need $\\mathscr C$ maps symmetric tensors to symmetric tensors and that $\\varepsilon:\\mathscr C\\varepsilon$ is always positive.\n",

    "Plate theory is what you get when you assume the medium is thin along the vertical dimension and that this simplifies the displacements.\n",

    "The classical theory is the [Kirchoff-Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%E2%80%93Love_plate_theory) plate.\n",
    "The Kirchoff theory assumes, for example, that any straight line that's perpendicular to the middle of the plate remains straight and perpendicular after deformation.\n",
    "These assumptions let us write down the other components of the deformation in terms of $w$:\n",
    "$$u_x = -z\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}, \\quad u_y = -z\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}.$$\n",
