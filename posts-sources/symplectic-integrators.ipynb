    "An introductory class in numerical ODE will show you how to construct convergent discretization schemes.\n",

    "We showed a simulation of several particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential, which is spherically symmetric.\n",
    "Things get much more complicated when there are rotational degrees of freedom.\n",
    "The rotational degrees of freedom live not in flat Euclidean space but on the Lie group SO(3), and the angular momenta in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n",
    "More generally, there are specialized methods for problems with constraints, such as being a rotation matrix, or being confined to a surface.\n",
