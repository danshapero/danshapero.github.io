    "In the previous demo, we looked at a few spatial and temporal discretizations of the nonlinear shallow water equations.\n",
    "One of the challenging parts about solving systems of hyperbolic PDE like the shallow water equations is choosing a timestep that satisfies the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition.\n",
    "You can pick a good timestep ahead of time for a linear autonomous system.\n",
    "A nonlinear system, on the other hand, might wander into weird parts of phase space where the characteristic wave speeds are much higher.\n",
    "You might be able to pick a good timestep from the outset, but it's likely to be overly conservative and waste loads of compute time.\n",
    "The tyranny of the CFL condition is the reason why it's such a common grumble among practitioners that ocean models explode if you look at them sideways.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the timestepping schemes we used in the previous demo were Runge-Kutta methods, which look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{n + 1} = z_n + \\delta t\\cdot \\sum_ib_ik_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_i$ are weights and the stages $k_i$ are defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_i = f\\left(z_n + \\delta t\\sum_ja_{ij}k_j\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the method to be explicit, we would need that $a_{ij} = 0$ if $j \\ge i$.\n",
    "You can find all the conditions for a Runge-Kutta method to have a certain order of accuracy in time in books like Hairer and Wanner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit Runge-Kutta schemes can eliminate many of the frustrating stability issues that occur with explicit schemes.\n",
    "Implicit methods can use timesteps that far exceed the CFL-stable timestep.\n",
    "But they introduce the added complexity of having to solve a nonlinear system at every timestep.\n",
    "What globalization strategy will you use for Newton's method?\n",
    "What preconditioner will you use in solving the associated linear systems?\n",
    "These are all decisions you didn't have to make before.\n",
    "It's possible to reduce some of the pain and suffering by using schemes for which $a_{ii}$ can be nonzero but $a_{ij} = 0$ if $j > 0$ -- these are the *diagonally-implicit* Runge-Kutta schemes.\n",
    "Rather than have to solve a gigantic nonlinear system for all of the stages $k_i$ at once, you only have to solve a sequence of nonlinear systems for each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Rosenbrock methods is to **perform only a single iteration of Newton's method** for the nonlinear system defining the Runge-Kutta stages, rather than actually solve that system to convergence.\n",
    "There are two heuristic justifications for Rosenbrock schemes.\n",
    "First, a scheme like implicit Euler is only first-order accurate in time anyway, so there isn't much reason to do a really accurate nonlinear system solve as part of a fairly crude timestepping scheme.\n",
    "Second, for a timestep that isn't too much larger than the characteristic timescale of the problem, the current system state is probably either in the quadratic convergence basin for Newton's method or at least fairly close.\n",
    "\n",
    "More general Rosenbrock schemes follow from this idea.\n",
    "The best reference I've found is one of the original papers on the subject, [Kaps and Rentrop (1979)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01396495).\n",
    "This paper shows more general schemes in this family, derives the order conditions for the various weights and parameters, and perhaps most importantly derives an embedded Rosenbrock scheme that can be used for adaptive timestep control.\n",
    "Here we'll show one of the most basic schemes, which comes from taking a single Newton step for the implicit midpoint rule."

    "The two biggest problems we ran into were getting a CFL-stable timestep and controlling energy drift.\n",
    "Rosenbrock schemes almost eliminate stability problems and decimate the drift as well.\n",
    "While they are substantially more expensive for a single timestep, there are a lot of gains to be had by using a better preconditioner.\n",
    "On top of that, we can gain other efficiencies by approximating the linearized dynamics with a matrix that's easier to invert."
