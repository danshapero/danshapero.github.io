    "The natural choices to make about spatial and temporal discretization for parabolic and hyperbolic problems are complete opposites.\n",
    "To solve a PDE that combines aspects of both types, finding a good middle ground can be a challenge.\n",

    "For time discretization, operator splitting helps turn a harder problem into two easy ones.\n",
    "In this post we only showed a first-order splitting scheme, but [Strang splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strang_splitting) achieves second-order accuracy with only a little more work.\n",
    "Operator splitting is a great trick generally but achieving more than first-order accuracy for more than three operators or more is much harder than for two."
