    "A *conservation law* is a type of PDE that describes the transport of extensive quantities like mass, momentum, and energy.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot f(q) = s,$$\n",

    "Here we'll look at the simplest conservation law of them all, the *advection equation*: $q$ is a scalar field and $f(q) = qu$ for some velocity field $u$.\n",
    "As we'll see, there are lots of ways to screw up something as simple as the advection equation, so learning what the common error modes are will help when attacking harder problems like the shallow water or Euler equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenging things about solving hyperbolic problems is that the class of reasonable solutions includes functions with jump discontinuities, and for some problems this is true even when the initial data are smooth.\n",
    "Compare that to, say, elliptic problems, where the solution is almost always smoother than the input data.\n",
    "For elliptic problems, it's common to use continuous basis functions, but when we try to use the same basis for conservation laws we can run up against some very nasty stability problems.\n",
    "It's possible to work around these issues by using tricks like the streamlined upwind Petrov-Galerkin method.\n",
    "But almost any approach to stabilizing a CG discretization introduces (1) free parameters that can be difficult to tune right and (2) an unrealistic level of numerical diffusion.\n",
    "For these reasons, the **discontinuous Galerkin method** is very popular for these kinds of problems.\n",
    "The DG method has good local conservation properties, it can achieve high-order accuracy where the solution is smooth, and there are more options in how you guarantee a stable scheme.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $\\phi$ be some basis function and let $K$ be the cell of the domain where $\\phi$ is supported.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperbolic problems are hard.\n",
    "There are difficult decisions to make even at the level of how to formulate the discrete problem.\n",
    "For this demo, we were looking at a scalar conservation laws, and the upwind flux works quite well.\n",
    "But for systems of conservation laws, like the shallow water equations, things become much more involved.\n",
    "You have to know something at an analytical level about the underlying problem -- the wave speeds.\n",
    "Once we've decided which discrete problem to solve, going beyond first-order accuracy is filled with even more challenges.\n",
    "Some issues, like getting a stable enough timestep, often require manual tuning.\n",
    "For the linear problem shown here, we know what the wave speeds are from the outset and we have reasonable confidence that we can pick a good timestep that will work for the entire simulation.\n",
    "The solutions of nonlinear conservation laws can meander to regions of state space where the wave speeds are much higher than where they started and an initially stable timestep becomes unstable.\n",
    "The Right Thing To Do is to use an adaptive timestepping scheme.\n",
    "But you now have the added implementational difficulty of tracking a higher- and lower-order solution with which to inform the adaptation strategy.\n",
    "Hopefully this has shown what some of the typical pitfalls are and what tools are available to remedy them."
