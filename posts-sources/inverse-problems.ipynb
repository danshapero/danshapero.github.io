    "The dual space $H^{-1}(\\Omega)$ is isometric to the primal, *but* to evaluate the mapping between them, we have to solve an elliptic PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sobolev space $H^1(\\Omega)$ is a relatively tame one in the grand scheme of things.\n",
    "Real problems might involve controls in Banach spaces with no inner product structure at all.\n",

    "In general, conductivity fields can be discontinuous, although not wildly so.\n",

    "Nonetheless, the discretization via finite elements can obscure the distinction between the primal and dual spaces.\n",

    "What's confusing is that these numbers don't mean the same thing.\n",
    "The array living under $q$ represents its coefficients in the finite element basis for the space $Q$, while the array for $d\\hat J/dq$ represents its coefficients in the *dual* basis.\n",

    "The laziest way we could possibly do so is to multiply $d\\hat J/dq$ by the inverse of the finite element mass matrix.\n",
    "Maybe we should instead use a 2nd-order elliptic operator; we assumed that the controls live in an $H^1$-conforming space.\n",
    "But for illustrative purposes the mass matrix will do fine.\n",
