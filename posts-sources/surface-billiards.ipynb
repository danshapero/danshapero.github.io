    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing constraints in solvers for Hamiltonian systems introduces several new difficulties.\n",
    "The basic second-order splitting scheme for unconstrained problems is pretty easy to implement and verify.\n",
    "While the RATTLE algorithm looks to be not much more complicated, it's very easy to introduce subtle off-by-one errors -- for example, accidentally evaluating the constraint derivative at the midpoint instead of the starting position.\n",
    "These mistakes manifest themselves as slightly too large deviations from energy conservation, but these deviations aren't necessarily large in any relative sense.\n",
    "The resulting scheme might still converge to the true solution, in which case the energy deviation will go to zero for any finite time interval.\n",
    "So measuring the reduction in the energy errors asymptotically as $\\delta t \\to 0$ probably won't catch this type of problem.\n",
    "It may be possible to instead calculate what the next-order term is in the Hamiltonian for the modified system using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, but that may be pretty rough in the presence of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation may be fiddly and annoying, but it is still possible to preserve much of the symplectic structure when constraints are added.\n",
    "The fact that structure-preserving integrators exist at all shouldn't be taken as a given.\n",
    "For example, there don't appear to be any simple structure-preserving adaptive integration schemes; see chapter 9 of [Leimkuhler and Reich](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511614118).\n",
    "The shallow water equations are a Hamiltonian PDE and deriving symplectic schemes that include the necessary upwinding is [pretty hard](https://doi-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.109016).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several respects in which the code I wrote above is sub-optimal.\n",
    "For the multi-particle simulation, the constraints are applied to each particle and consequently the constraint derivative matrix $J$ is very sparse and $J\\cdot J^\\top$ is diagonal.\n",
    "For expediency's sake, I just used a dense matrix, but this scales very poorly to more particles.\n",
    "A serious implementation would either represent $J$ as a sparse matrix or would go matrix-free by providing routines to calculate the product of $J$ or $J^\\top$ with a vector.\n",
    "I also implemented the projection of the momentum back onto the cotangent space by solving the normal equations, which is generally speaking a bad idea.\n",
    "The matrix $J\\cdot J^\\top$ was diagonal for our problem, so this approach will probably work out fine.\n",
    "For more complex problems, we may be better off solving a least-squares problem with the matrix $J^\\top$ using either the QR or singular value decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I used a simple interaction potential just so we could see something interesting happen.\n",
    "The potential goes to a finite value at zero separation, which is a little unphysical.\n",
    "A much more serious deficiency was that the potential is defined using the particles' coordinates in 3D Cartesian space.\n",
    "Ideally, we would do everything in a way that relies as little on how the surface is embedded into Euclidean space as possible, which would mean using the *geodesic* distance instead."
