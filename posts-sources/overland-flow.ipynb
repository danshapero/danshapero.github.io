    "For many thin open channel flows, however, the fluid velocity can be expressed purely in terms of the surface slope and other factors.\n",
    "You could arrive at one such simplification by assuming that the inertial terms in the momentum equation are zero:\n",

    "$$k|u|u + gh\\nabla(b + h) = 0.$$\n",

    "This approximation is known as the [Darcy-Weisbach equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%E2%80%93Weisbach_equation).\n",

    "For serious work, you'd probably want to use the [Manning formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_formula), as it has some [theoretical justification](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.014501) for turbulent open channel flows.\n",

    "This looks like a parabolic equation, but there's a catch!\n",
    "The diffusion coefficient is proportional to $h^{3/2}$, so it can go to zero when $h = 0$; all the theory for elliptic and parabolic equations assumes that the diffusion coefficient is bounded below.\n",
    "For a non-degenerate parabolic PDE, disturbances propagate with infinite speed.\n",
    "For the degenerate problem we're considering, that's no longer true -- the $h = 0$ contour travels with finite speed!\n",
    "While we're using the Darcy-Weisbach equation to set the velocity here, we still get finite propagation speed if we use the Manning equation instead.\n",
    "What's important is that the velocity is propertional to some power of the thickness and surface slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eliminating the velocity entirely from the problem is convenient for analysis, but not necessarily the best way to go numerically.\n",
    "We'll retain the velocity as an unknown, which gives the resulting variational form much of the same character as the mixed discretization of the heat equation.\n",

    "As our model problem, we'll use the dam break test case from [Santillana and Dawson (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2009.11.016).\n",
    "They discretized the overland flow equations using the *local* discontinuous Galerkin or LDG method, which extends DG for hyperbolic systems to mixed advection-diffusion problems.\n",

    "The fudge flux is 1/25 that of the average.\n",
    "This is quite a bit smaller, but not so much so that we should feel comfortable with this large a perturbation to the physics equations themselves.\n",
    "The ability to use it only in the derivative and not in the residual is a huge help.\n",
    "\n",
    "To wrap things up, the overland flow equations are a perfect demonstration of how trivially equivalent forms of the same physical problem can yield vastly different discretizations.\n",
    "Writing the system as a single parabolic PDE might seem simplest, but there are several potential zeros in the denominator that require some form of regularization.\n",
    "By contrast, using a mixed form introduces more unknowns and a nonlinear equation for the flux, but there's wiggle room within that nonlinear equation.\n",
    "This makes it much easier to come up with a robust solution procedure, even if it includes a few uncomfortable hacks like using a different Jacobian from that of the true problem.\n",
    "Finally, while our discretization still works ok with no positivity constraint, PETSc has variational inequality solvers that make it possible to enforce positivity."
