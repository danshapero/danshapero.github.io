    "# Mantle convection\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is taken from a chapter in [The FEniCS Book](https://fenicsproject.org/book/), which is available for free online.\n",
    "That chapter is in turn an implementation of a model setup from [van Keken et al (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1029/97JB01353).\n",
    "I took just the thermomechanical parts and removed the chemistry.\n",
    "This paper and the code from the FEniCS book all use a non-dimensional form of the equations, which I've adopted here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll see the Stokes equations again, but we'll couple them to the evolution of temperature.\n",
    "The temperature evolution is an advection-diffusion equation.\n",
    "The extensive quantity for heat transport is the internal energy density $E = \\rho c_p T$ where $\\rho$, $c_p$ are the mass density and the specific heat at constant pressure.\n",
    "The flux of heat when there is bulk movement of the medium at a velocity $u$ is\n",
    "$$F = \\rho c_p T u - k\\nabla T.$$\n",
    "There are two modes of heat transport: convection and diffusion.\n",
    "We'll assume there are no zero heat sources but you could add some from radiogenic nuclides or strain heating.\n",
    "The variational form of the heat equation is:\n",
    "$$\\int_\\Omega\\left\\{\\partial_t(\\rho c_p T)\\,\\phi - (\\rho c_p Tu - k\\nabla T)\\cdot\\nabla\\phi - Q\\phi\\right\\}dx = 0$$\n",
    "for all test functions $\\phi$.\n",
    "The variational form of the momentum balance equation is\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot \\tau - \\nabla p + \\rho g = 0$$\n",
    "where $\\tau = 2\\mu\\dot\\varepsilon$ is the deviatoric stress tensor and $p$ the pressure.\n",
    "The characteristic that makes this problem interesting is that we assume the flow is just barely compressible.\n",
    "This is called the [Boussinesq approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boussinesq_approximation_(buoyancy)).\n",
    "In practice, it means we do two apparently contradictory things.\n",
    "First, we assume that the flow is incompressible:\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot u = 0.$$\n",
    "Second, we assume that it actually is compressible, and that the degree of compression is linear in the temperature:\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\rho_0(1 - \\beta(T - T_0))$$\n",
    "where $\\rho_0$ is a reference density and $\\beta$ is thermal expansion coefficient.\n",
    "These assumptions aren't consistent with each other.\n",
    "I find that uncomfortable.\n",
    "But I would find writing a full compressible solver to be blinding agony.\n",
    "Anyway it lets us make pretty pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't go into a full non-dimensionalization of the problem, which is detailed in the van Keken paper.\n",
    "The most important dimensionless numbers for this system are the [Prandtl number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl_number) and the [Rayleigh number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_number).\n",
    "The Prandtl number quantifies the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity:\n",
    "$$\\text{Pr} = \\frac{\\mu / \\rho}{k / \\rho c_p} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa}$$\n",
    "where $\\nu$ and $\\kappa$ are respectively the kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity.\n",
    "For mantle flows, the Prandtl number is on the order of $10^{25}$.\n",
    "We can get a sense for a characteristic velocity scale from the momentum balance equation.\n",
    "First, we can take a factor of $\\rho_0g$ into the pressure.\n",
    "If we take $U$, $L$, and $\\Delta T$ to be the characteristic velocity, length, and temperature difference scales, then\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mu U}{L^2} \\approx \\rho_0g\\beta\\Delta T$$\n",
    "which then implies that $U = \\rho_0g\\beta L^2\\Delta T / \\mu$.\n",
    "Now we can compute the thermal Péclet number, which\n",
    "$$\\text{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{\\kappa},$$\n",
    "which is called the Péclet number, to tell whether convection or diffusion dominates.\n",
    "When the Péclet number is large, we're in the convection-dominated regime; when it's small, we're in the diffusion-dominated regime.\n",
    "Taking our estimate of velocity scale from before, we get\n",
    "$$\\text{Pe} = \\frac{\\rho_0 g \\beta L^3 \\Delta T}{\\kappa\\mu}.$$\n",
    "This is identical to the Rayleigh number, which we'll write as $\\text{Ra}$.\n",
    "Lord Rayleigh famously used linear stability analysis to show that a fluid that is heated from below and cooled from above is unstable when the Rayleigh number exceeds 600 or so.\n",
    "Here we'll take the Rayleigh number to be equal to $10^6$ as in the van Keken paper.\n",
    "It's a worthwhile exercise in numerical analysis to see what it takes to make a solver go for higher values of the Rayleigh number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're using a rectangular domain.\n",
    "Again, the spatial scales have been non-dimensionalized."
