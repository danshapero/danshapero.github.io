    "There are a host of methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations by breaking them up into two simpler problems.\n",
    "These are known as [projection methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_method_(fluid_dynamics)).\n",
    "I started out trying those but it required effort, which I find disgusting.\n",
    "So I threw backward Euler at it and it worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some non-trivial decisions to make about both the variational form and the boundary conditions.\n",
    "I started writing this wanting to use pressure boundary conditions at both the inflow and outflow.\n",
    "(Of course I had to [be reminded](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/35928/imposing-pressure-variation-instead-of-dirichlet-boundary-conditions-on-finite-e) that you can't prescribe pressures but rather tractions.)\n",
    "This went badly.\n",
    "If a wave reflects off of the obstacle, back upstream, and out the inflow boundary, the simulation will crash.\n",
    "So I had to dial back the challenge and use a fixed inflow velocity and a traction boundary condition at the outflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost any writing you see about the Navier-Stokes equations will express the problem in differential form and will use incompressibility to apply what might appear to be simplifications.\n",
    "For example, if the fluid is incompressible and the viscosity is constant, then you can rewrite the viscous term like so:\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot \\mu(\\nabla u + \\nabla u^\\top) = \\mu\\nabla^2u.$$\n",
    "You'll see this form in almost all numerical methods or engineering textbooks.\n",
    "I don't like it for two reasons.\n",
    "First, the apparent simplification only gets in your way as soon as you want to consider fluids with variable viscosity.\n",
    "Mantle convection is one obvious case -- the temperature and chemistry of mantle rock can change the viscosity by several orders of magnitude.\n",
    "Second, it gives the wrong boundary conditions when you try to discretize the problem (see [Limache et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1480)).\n",
    "I've retained the symmetric gradients of the velocity and test function in the form below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second apparent simplification uses incompressibility to rewrite the convection term:\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot \\rho u\\otimes u = u\\cdot\\nabla \\rho u.$$\n",
    "This form is ubiquitous and reflects a preference for thinking about fluid flow in a Lagrangian reference frame.\n",
    "I prefer to avoid it although both are correct, unlike the Laplacian form of the viscosity.\n",
    "Given any extensive density $\\phi$, regardless of its tensor rank, the flux will include a term $\\phi\\cdot u$.\n",
    "The conversion of this flux from the conservation to the variational form is then\n",
    "$$-\\int_\\Omega \\phi u\\cdot\\nabla\\psi\\,dx$$\n",
    "and this is true of mass, momentum, energy, whatever you like.\n",
    "Taking something that was a divergence and making it not a divergence obfuscates the original conservation principle.\n",
    "It also stops you from pushing the differential operator over onto a test function.\n",
    "So I've instead coded up the convection term as a discretization of\n",
